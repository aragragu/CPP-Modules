- in the cpoy contructur function why do we pass it as const
- also what is the difference between malloc and new and free and delete
-  i wanna understand what happens under the hode when i pass an object by reference or by value and if i wanted to issinge the data momber of an object with the reference of of another object what happens in there also what happens whene passing an object by value to initialize the data member of another object and why would i use a reference instead of a normal variable
